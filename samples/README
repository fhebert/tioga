This is the README for the Tioga samples folder.

The samples can serve both as a tutorial and a source of code
fragments to provide a start on writing your own Tioga documents.

The "figures" folder has the most basic stuff.

Next comes "plots" which extends the discussion to the methods
needed to make plots.

The "pythagorian_3_body" makes plots and a movie of the evolution of
a system of 3 "stars" that start from rest at the corners of a 3-4-5 right
triangle.  The star opposite the side of length 3 has a mass of 3 units,
the one opposite the length 4 side has a mass of 4 units, and the final
one has a mass of 5 units.  The output file has a record of one particular
integration run show how this system might evolve under the influence of
the mutual gravitational attractions.

The final three folders, "star_history", "star_profile", and "zams",
come from my own stellar evolution work.  They give further "real life"
examples of non-trivial applications.

For more information and a suggested exploration path, see
the Tutorial in the Tioga documentation.
