= Tutorial

This tutorial gives a guided tour through the programs included in the "samples" subfolder
found in the installation folder.  The hope is that it will give you
an understanding of the samples that will let you pick and choose from them as a way of
getting started on your own applications.

The tutorial also contains material introducing the command
line interface and the graphical interface (for the Mac) along with hints and suggestions for using Tioga
effectively.

The first step is to locate the samples folder and take a look at what's inside.  You should find a +README+ and 5 subfolders.

* figures
* plots
* star_history
* star_profile
* zams

The +README+ file basically just directs readers to this documentation.  The "figures" subfolder has the most basic stuff.
Next comes "plots" which extends the discussion to the methods
needed to make plots. The final three folders, "star_history", "star_profile", and "zams",
come from my own stellar evolution work.  They give "real life"
examples of non-trivial applications. 

Here are the sections of the tutorial, in the order they are intended to be read.

UsingRuby -- The bare essentials for using Ruby with Tioga

DocStructure -- The basic anatomy of a Tioga document and "batch-mode" operation

Sample -- Intro to using "irb" as a Tioga front-end

Figures -- How Tioga uses PDF and TeX to make figures

SimpleFigure -- A first look at a nontrivial Tioga figure definition

TextForTeX -- How to Add Packages and How (and How Not) to Enter Text for TeX

MacGUI -- Intro to Tioga's graphical user interface for the Mac

Plots -- The extras for making plots

Data -- Tools for reading and manipulating the data for plots

SampledData -- Making plots with a false-color image of sampled data

Animation -- How to create a sequence of PDFs and convert it to a movie

OtherStuff -- A few "real life" examples

Epilog -- "Do it yourself" using the Tioga kernel for making figures
