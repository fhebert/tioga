<< What's new >>

	Version 1.3.2
	
		In addition to the items Vincent described below for 1.3.1, there are also some 
new enhancements to the irb_tioga package.  As you probably recall, it is a Tioga 
front-end in irb that provides a set of commands to make pdf's and get them
opened in your favorite previewer.  The basic 3-window model of operation is to have
your Tioga ruby source file open in a text editor window, irb open in a terminal
window, and the PDF file open in a previewer.  You edit and save the ruby program 
for your figure or plot, type a command to irb_tioga to get the file reloaded and 
the pdf recreated, then look at the result in the previewer.  Repeat until happy!

		The recent additions to irb_tioga are simply further efforts to make that
cycle smoother.  There's a new command, called "reload_and_review" ("rr" for short),
that combines the standard operations into one: it reloads the new version of
the ruby file, rebuilds the most recently created figures, and opens it in the
previewer.  And if typing "rr<return>" is too much for you, remember that irb
has a nice history feature, so you can just type up-arrow and return.  Cool!

		I often have Tioga files that define a long list of figures.  There's another
new command in irb_tioga that writes the list of figures with numbers to a file
and then opens that file.  So now in addition to the 3 windows mentioned above,
I also have another text editor window with a list of figures giving numbers and
names -- a quick glance at that is enough to tell me what number to give to the
"pv" command in irb_tioga to get the figure I want.

		Finally, some previewers need a gentle kick in the pants to reload a PDF file
after it has been modified.  For example, Preview on the Mac discards requests to
open a PDF that it already has opened, even if the file has been written since
the previous open.  Happily, other people have solved this one for us.  There's a 
simple script that gets Preview to do "Open/Revert" -- I'll send out a copy of this in
an email to tioga-news.

	Cheers,
	Bill

	  Version 1.3.1 is as usual a bug-fix release, although bugs
were not that obvious this time. Among other things,
  * it fixes some troubles with IRB and the Mac GUI
  * it fixes the use of Tioga custom colors in the LaTeX materials,
  such as in one of the figures in samples/figures/figures.rb. 
  * quite a bit of code cleaning
  * some documentation updates
  * and, last but not least, the samples/ directory now contains a shell
  script to create and optionally display all the figures defined in
  one IRB Tioga ruby file. If, say, you can use gv to view PDFs, try
  out the following line:

  cd samples; ./make_plots --viewer gv figures/figures.rb
  
  Enjoy !!

<< What's old >>
	
		Vincent has added a #primitive method to Function (during breaks from
writing his thesis).


    	There is a new contour algorithm.  Thank you to Roy Mayfield for telling me about the
Gri contour following routine (http://gri.sourceforge.net/).  Tioga's make_contour method now
uses that as its default;  the previous algorithm, CONREC, is still available as an option.
However, the new one seems superior -- especially if you'd like to be able to fill the contour
rather than simply stroke it.  In addition, you can optionally provide it with a "mask" of flags
indicating which entries in the table are valid for use in forming the contours.  Neat stuff.
	
		Version 1.3.0 will automatically remove the tex temporary files it creates
(unless the autocleanup attribute is set false).  Commands that used to have
"preview" in their names have been renamed to remove it.  For example, the
old tex_preview_fontfamily is now called tex_fontfamily.  (The old names are
actually still around for backward compatibility, but we won't be mentioning
them anymore!)  Some other commands have gone away completely since they 
have been made obsolete by the new approach of page layout using the
enter page function.  As a reminder, here's what I wrote in a recent email 
about the change in my model of what Tioga is really doing:

      In the "old days", I thought of Tioga as producing intermediate files 
      (the *_figure.tex and *_figure.txt files) that would at some later time 
      be combined by TeX to create a figure in a TeX document.  So, in that view, 
      the "final" figure PDF was created by TeX as part of typesetting a document.  
      However, I naturally wanted to see what the figure looked like while I was 
      debugging it, and so there was a "preview" ability in Tioga as well.  And 
      before long it became clear that I was looking at things in the "wrong" way.

      So there was a reversal in my image, and now I think of the process as Tioga 
      producing the final PDF for the figure and, as part of that, calling TeX as 
      a subroutine to get the job done.  Then the figure PDF can be used however 
      you wish -- as part of a TeX document of course, but for anything else as 
      well.  There is no longer any need for a "preview" and the *_figure files 
      can be deleted immediately since they're now just temporaries created to 
      drive TeX.

      There wasn't too much needed to provide better support for this new view 
      of things.  Mainly, you need to be able to specify exact sizes for figure 
      and fonts.

      Now for specifics.  Please take a quick look at tioga samples/plots/plots.rb 
      that is part of the download.   At the end of the initialize routine, at line 63, 
      there is a new addition:

              t.def_enter_page_function { enter_page }

      This tells tioga that whenever it is about to create a new PDF page, it should 
      call the 'enter_page' method which is defined in the next few lines of the file:

          def enter_page
              t.page_setup(11*72/2,8.5*72/2)
              t.set_frame_sides(0.15,0.85,0.85,0.15) # left, right, top, bottom in page coords       
          end

      The page_setup routine takes the desired width and height in "big points" (72 per inch).
      So in this case, the PDF will be 5.5 inches wide and 4.25 inches high.  The set_frame_sides 
      routine takes fractional positions on the page (i.e., page coordinates).  If you wanted 
      to change the fonts, you could do that in the enter_page routine as well by adding a 
      line like this:

              t.set_default_font_size(14)

      I hope this helps to clarify things.

=======
>>>>>>> 1.21
	Version 1.2.1 is as usual a bug-fix release fixing some installation problems...

	Version 1.2.0 brings in a lot of new features. First and most important, we came up with a
proper design for a real-size scheme. Now, you can use the page_setup function to ask Tioga to
produce a preview PDF of the exact size requested, so that you can include the PDF directly in
your documents (not only LaTeX, then). A whole bunch of debugging tools have been added: you can
now set tracing tools with the (enter|exit)_(show_plot|subplot|subfigure) functions. As usual,
there is a whole bunch of small improvements and new functions to Dvector and Function.

	Version 1.1.7 fixes a nasty runtime bug on MacOS X.

	Version 1.1.6 provides marshalling for Dtable and Dvector. You can now use Marshal.dump and
Marshal.load with Dvectors. Dvectors and Function now have a bounds function, which return both the
minima and the maxima. Ruby is no longer complaining about Tioga when used with the -w switch.

	Version 1.1.5 is a bug-fix release - updated to the latest mkmf2.rb to make sure all
necessary files are generated during make.

	Version 1.1.4 is a bug-fix release - a nasty symbol clash was preventing Tioga from running
on MacOS X.3. This should now be fixed. Moreover, the load time should improve a little bit on few 
architectures.

	Version 1.1.3 provides a better integration of output within LaTeX
documents. A tioga.sty file is now available, with many macros for figure
inclusion and color names like the ones provided by Tioga.

	The Dobjects module is proud to announce the birth of the latest
class, Function, which provides basic interpolation and sorting for sets of
X,Y data. Not many features for now, but there's room for plenty more work.

	Dvector provides a few more functions:
		clear?, dirty?, dirty= (to check if a vector has been modified)
		min_gt, max_lt (extrema with conditions)
		set (mass modification of Dvector)

	FigureMaker has now functions for coordinate conversions:
		convert_inches_to_output, convert_output_to_inches,
		convert_mm_to_output, convert_output_to_mm

	Version 1.1.2 provides more complete control over page layout and font
selection.  Here's a list of new features:

		for top-level page layout
			set_device_pagesize(width, height) # measured in tenths of points
			set_A4_portrait, set_A4_landscape
			set_A5_portrait, set_A5_landscape
			set_B5_portrait, set_B5_landscape
			set_JB5_portrait, set_JB5_landscape
			set_USLegal_portrait, set_USLegal_landscape
			set_USLetter_portrait, set_USLetter_landscape
			set_frame_sides(left, right, top, bottom) # sizes in page coords [0..1]

		for TeX preview page and figure size
			tex_preview_paper_width
			tex_preview_paper_height
			tex_preview_hoffset
			tex_preview_voffset
			tex_preview_figure_width
			tex_preview_figure_height

		for TeX preview font selection
			tex_preview_fontsize
			tex_preview_fontfamily
			tex_preview_fontseries
			tex_preview_fontshape

	Version 1.1.1 is the first Tioga to be called a "beta" release.  You can
interpret that anyway you'd like, but to me it means Tioga has been around long
enough and had enough use to justify inviting more folks to give it a try.
The "alpha" label is a warning to "proceed at your own risk", and only brave
souls go ahead when they see that.  I think Tioga has gotten stable enough
that we can drop the "threat level" down a notch.  (Fingers crossed of course!)


	Version 1.1.0 splits off the Dvector & Dtable modules from the FigureMaker so
that they can be used in other packages (Vincent Fourmond both suggested this and
did the work to make it happen).


    Version 1.0.M no longer raises error for calls on 'stroke', 'fill', and such with an empty path.
It has also been reconfigured to support the new Mac GUI which now works with both PowerPC and Intel
processors.

    Version 1.0.L adds 'transparency' as a synonym for (1.0 - opacity).  So
now you can set 'fill_transparency' to 0.3 instead of setting 'fill_opacity'
to 0.7.  I'm sure that makes your day.  The documentation has also been
updated of course.

    Version 1.0.K was Vincent Fourmond's fault!  The same day that J was released,
he sent me an email pointing out an oversight in the legend functionality.
Not only that, he sent along an implementation to fix the problem!  What could I do?
I had to put it in and make a new release.  So thanks to Vincent, you can now include 
markers on the lines in legends.  Details in the new documentation for 'save_legend_info'.


<< Quick Installation of Tioga >>

    Are you feeling lucky?  If so, try QUICK_INSTALL.  This simply does
the steps for you that are described below.  The install needs to copy some
files to the ruby directory.  On the Mac, this probably means you need to do
the whole thing with a 'sudo'.  For Linux, you may have to become root.
Once you've taken care of that, just run the QUICK_INSTALL script and
keep your fingers crossed.

    You now have the option to run HOME_INSTALL instead, which will install the files to 
your home directory (no root privileges needed). You just need to set your RUBYLIB 
environment variable as reminded at the end of the file.

    Please check that there are 0 failures and 0 errors at the end of the test.
Then, in your favorite PDF previewer, open the newly created 'tests/Icon_Test.pdf'
and compare it to the prebuilt 'samples/Icon.pdf'.  They should be very similar!
If it all seems to be working, go directly to the << Documentation >> section below.


<< Step-by-Step Installation >>

    To get Tioga running, you need to have a working Ruby, a C compiler,
make, and pdflaxtex.  Assuming you've got all that (more later if you don't),
connect to the Tioga directory that you just unpacked and do the following:

  [ this has been changed, be careful ! ]

    cd split 
    ruby extconf.rb
    make
    make install

This creates the Makefile, runs it, and finally does the actual
installation.  The "make install" needs to copy some files to the ruby directory.
On the Mac, this probably means you need to do the whole thing inside a 'sudo'.
For Linux, you may have to become root.

Note that on Linux, the make will compile all the source files.  On the Mac,
the tar file includes precompiled versions of everything, so the make won't
have anything to do.  That's okay.  Do the whole sequence anyway just to be safe.

    You now have another option to install: if you replace the line
    ruby extconf.rb
with 
    ruby extconf.rb --home
it will install the files to your home directory, namely ~/lib/ruby. You don't need root 
privileges to do that, but make sure that you set RUBYLIB=~/lib/ruby somewhere, so that ruby 
can find it.




<< Checking The Installation >>

    To make sure at least something works of out the newly installed stuff,
change directory to your new Tioga folder.  Then enter this to the shell:

    cd tests
    ruby ts_Tioga.rb
    
This should produce something like the following if the install worked:

	Loaded suite ts_Tioga
	Started
	.....................................................
	compressed from 0 to 8
	compressed from 13 to 21
	compressed from 70 to 69
	compressed from 3631 to 1642
	.pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode Icon_Test.tex > pdflatex.log
 
 
 
	>>> NOTE: please look at tests/Icon_Test.pdf and compare it to samples/Icon.pdf
	.
	Finished in 0.501211 seconds.

	55 tests, 647 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors

These tests ensure that Tioga is accessible and that some of the basic stuff is working.
Don't skip the visual check of the newly created file 'tests/Icon_Test.pdf'.
If that's ok, there's a good chance your installation is up and running.

The next step is to do the tutorial found in the documentation.



<< Tutorial >>

    Once you have Tioga installed, the on-line tutorial will help you
get started using it.

<< Documentation >>

    Visit this website to access the documentation:
    
        http://theory.kitp.ucsb.edu/~paxton/tioga_doc/index.html

If for some reason that link isn't working, go to my website,

        http://theory.kitp.ucsb.edu/~paxton

and check there for a new link to the Tioga stuff.

    Try to get by with the on-line documentation, but if you really
have a need to rebuild the documentation using Rdoc, I've
included a .document file in the release folder.  However, all
the figures have direct links to jpegs on my website, so you'll
either have to live with that, or do a bunch of edits.  Send me
an email if you'd like a tar file of the images.


<< Open Source >>

    You are welcome to take the Tioga source and do what you want with it
(within the bounds of the GNU license of course).  But don't even think about
asking for support from me for debugging your new stuff!  I have enough trouble
with my own bugs to keep me busy endlessly!  But if it looks like a bug in Tioga,
please do let me know so I can try to fix it.  Or even better, let me know
the fix along with the bug!
