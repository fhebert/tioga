<< What's new >>


	Version 1.1.1 is the first Tioga to be called a "beta" release.  You can
interpret that anyway you'd like, but to me it means Tioga has been around long
enough and had enough use to justify inviting more folks to give it a try.
The "alpha" label is a warning to "proceed at your own risk", and only brave
souls go ahead when they see that.  I think Tioga has gotten stable enough
that we can drop the "threat level" down a notch.  (Fingers crossed of course!)


	Version 1.1.0 splits off the Dvector & Dtable modules from the FigureMaker so
that they can be used in other packages (Vincent Fourmond both suggested this and
did the work to make it happen).


<< What's old >>


    Version 1.0.M no longer raises error for calls on 'stroke', 'fill', and such with an empty path.
It has also been reconfigured to support the new Mac GUI which now works with both PowerPC and Intel
processors.

    Version 1.0.L adds 'transparency' as a synonym for (1.0 - opacity).  So
now you can set 'fill_transparency' to 0.3 instead of setting 'fill_opacity'
to 0.7.  I'm sure that makes your day.  The documentation has also been
updated of course.

    Version 1.0.K was Vincent Fourmond's fault!  The same day that J was released,
he sent me an email pointing out an oversight in the legend functionality.
Not only that, he sent along an implementation to fix the problem!  What could I do?
I had to put it in and make a new release.  So thanks to Vincent, you can now include 
markers on the lines in legends.  Details in the new documentation for 'save_legend_info'.


<< Quick Installation of Tioga >>

    Are you feeling lucky?  If so, try QUICK_INSTALL.  This simply does
the steps for you that are described below.  The install needs to copy some
files to the ruby directory.  On the Mac, this probably means you need to do
the whole thing with a 'sudo'.  For Linux, you may have to become root.
Once you've taken care of that, just run the QUICK_INSTALL script and
keep your fingers crossed.

    You now have the option to run HOME_INSTALL instead, which will install the files to 
your home directory (no root privileges needed). You just need to set your RUBYLIB 
environment variable as reminded at the end of the file.

    Please check that there are 0 failures and 0 errors at the end of the test.
Then, in your favorite PDF previewer, open the newly created 'tests/Icon_Test.pdf'
and compare it to the prebuilt 'samples/Icon.pdf'.  They should be very similar!
If it all seems to be working, go directly to the << Documentation >> section below.


<< Step-by-Step Installation >>

    To get Tioga running, you need to have a working Ruby, a C compiler,
make, and pdflaxtex.  Assuming you've got all that (more later if you don't),
connect to the Tioga directory that you just unpacked and do the following:

  [ this has been changed, be careful ! ]

    cd split 
    ruby extconf.rb
    make
    make install

This creates the Makefile, runs it, and finally does the actual
installation.  The "make install" needs to copy some files to the ruby directory.
On the Mac, this probably means you need to do the whole thing inside a 'sudo'.
For Linux, you may have to become root.

Note that on Linux, the make will compile all the source files.  On the Mac,
the tar file includes precompiled versions of everything, so the make won't
have anything to do.  That's okay.  Do the whole sequence anyway just to be safe.

    You now have another option to install: if you replace the line
    ruby extconf.rb
with 
    ruby extconf.rb --home
it will install the files to your home directory, namely ~/lib/ruby. You don't need root 
privileges to do that, but make sure that you set RUBYLIB=~/lib/ruby somewhere, so that ruby 
can find it.




<< Checking The Installation >>

    To make sure at least something works of out the newly installed stuff,
change directory to your new Tioga folder.  Then enter this to the shell:

    cd tests
    ruby ts_Tioga.rb
    
This should produce something like the following if the install worked:

	Loaded suite ts_Tioga
	Started
	.....................................................
	compressed from 0 to 8
	compressed from 13 to 21
	compressed from 70 to 69
	compressed from 3631 to 1642
	.pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode Icon_Test.tex > pdflatex.log
 
 
 
	>>> NOTE: please look at tests/Icon_Test.pdf and compare it to samples/Icon.pdf
	.
	Finished in 0.501211 seconds.

	55 tests, 647 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors

These tests ensure that Tioga is accessible and that some of the basic stuff is working.
Don't skip the visual check of the newly created file 'tests/Icon_Test.pdf'.
If that's ok, there's a good chance your installation is up and running.

The next step is to do the tutorial found in the documentation.



<< Tutorial >>

    Once you have Tioga installed, the on-line tutorial will help you
get started using it.

<< Documentation >>

    Visit this website to access the documentation:
    
        http://theory.kitp.ucsb.edu/~paxton/tioga_doc/index.html

If for some reason that link isn't working, go to my website,

        http://theory.kitp.ucsb.edu/~paxton

and check there for a new link to the Tioga stuff.

    Try to get by with the on-line documentation, but if you really
have a need to rebuild the documentation using Rdoc, I've
included a .document file in the release folder.  However, all
the figures have direct links to jpegs on my website, so you'll
either have to live with that, or do a bunch of edits.  Send me
an email if you'd like a tar file of the images.


<< Open Source >>

    You are welcome to take the Tioga source and do what you want with it
(within the bounds of the GNU license of course).  But don't even think about
asking for support from me for debugging your new stuff!  I have enough trouble
with my own bugs to keep me busy endlessly!  But if it looks like a bug in Tioga,
please do let me know so I can try to fix it.  Or even better, let me know
the fix along with the bug!
